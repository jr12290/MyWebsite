    How did running begin

    Running was officially born as a sport in 776 B.C.E, in ancient Greece, in the town of Olympia. As long as legs have existed… Not the answer you’ve been looking for? The answer to the question “When was running invented?” 
     is a tough one to give. If you are asking about the very act of running, the answer is that the running was invented, in terms that we can comprehend and execute with our bodies, when the first known biped ran…to save its own life.
    Going forward to humans, or, to be more exact, Australopithecus (the early ancestor of humans), they first started running when they were being chased by predators…to save their own life.
    
    
    How did we discover running?

Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.
It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably to hunt animals. 
Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.
