  <h2> How did running begin</h2>  

    Running was officially born as a sport in 776 B.C.E, in ancient Greece, in the town of Olympia. As long as legs have existed… Not the answer you’ve been looking for? The answer to the question “When was running invented?” 
     is a tough one to give. If you are asking about the very act of running, the answer is that the running was invented, in terms that we can comprehend and execute with our bodies, when the first known biped ran…to save its own life.
    Going forward to humans, or, to be more exact, Australopithecus (the early ancestor of humans), they first started running when they were being chased by predators…to save their own life.
  They most probably perfected the act of running when they started hunting. Finally, running as sport i.e. competitive running dates back as far as ancient times in Greece, Egypt, Asia, and the East African Rift in Africa.
    You probably remember the tale of Philippides and the origin of Marathon.
    Albeit somewhat of a legend and not an official record, Philippides was tasked to run from the Marathon battlefield to Athens to announce the Persians’ defeat.
    The name of the legendary battlefield served to evoke this glorious run when the very first marathons started to take place.
    
   <h2> How did we discover running?
 </h2>
Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.
It is hypothesized that the ancestors of humankind developed the ability to run for long distances about 2.6 million years ago, probably to hunt animals. 
Competitive running grew out of religious festivals in various areas.

    <h2> All about football</h2>

    Some predecessors of football may date back to ancient Greece and Rome, and similar games were played in ancient China and Japan.
    The history of football in Britain dates at least to the eighth century CE. The development of association football has its origins in medieval ball games and English public school games.

    <h2> Facts about football</h2>
The earliest game that resembled association football in history is the Chinese game cuju. The history of the sport dates back to the Han Dynasty (206 BC – 220 AD). 
It was played by kicking a leather ball through 2 bamboo canes positioned 30 to 40 centimeters apart. Early alternatives to association football balls include animal skins, skulls, pig bladders, and more.
The oldest professional football club in the world still in existence today is Sheffield FC. The oldest professional football club in the world still in existence today is Sheffield FC.
There have been a total of 22 FIFA World Cup tournaments between 1930 and 2022. The World Cup is held every 4 years, except for 1942 and 1946, when it was canceled due to World War II. In 1964, after a referee disallowed a goal for Peru in an Olympic qualifying match between Argentina and Peru,
    a riot broke out killing over 300 spectators and injuring 500 more.  Uruguay is the only World Cup champion not to attempt to defend their title four years later. They refused to enter the 1934 World Cup hosted in Italy.
    It was considered a revenge snob towards Italy, as they refused to make the trip to Uruguay four years prior. Uruguay has only won gold medals at the Olympics for soccer in 1924 and 1928 – they haven’t won a gold since.
    A match in the Congo in 1998 ended in tragedy as lightning killed an entire team. The opposition was left untouched.The “100 Hours War” or “Football War” of 1969 was a short-lived war between Honduras and Salvador.
    The fighting broke out after Honduras beat El Salvadore during a World Cup qualifying match in Mexico.1958 saw 3 new teams qualify for the FIFA World Cup: Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Soviet Union.
    It was the first (and only) time all 4 of the Home Nations (England, Ireland, Scotland, Wales) made it to the World Cup. The FIFA World Cup in 1962 quickly became known as the “Battle of Santiago”
    following an incident between the host country Chile and Italy. Violence quickly erupted on the playing field after two players were sent off. And as a result yellow and red cards were invented. 
    The FIFA World Cup trophy was stolen in 1966, just a few days before the finals. It was later found by a dog called Pickles and returned to the exhibition at Westminster Central Hall.  Norway might not be considered the best country for soccer success,
    but they are the only football team not to lose to Brazil in international competition. They have two wins and two draws against the powerhouse.

    <h1> How did basketball begin</h1>

    On December 21, 1891, 30-year-old James Naismith introduces the first game of basketball. Based on 13 rules created by Naismith,
    the game is tested by 18 students at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School in Springfield, Massachusetts.

    <h2> Who invented basket ball</h2>

    James Naismith was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, Christian chaplain, and sports coach, best known as the inventor of the game of basketball.
    After moving to the United States, he wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. 
    
    Players never could advance the ball. Instead, each player had to throw it from wherever he caught it. The first team credited with advancing the ball by dribbling it played at Yale in 1897 and the official allowance for the dribble, 
    just one per possession at first,were adopted four years later.
